If you're watching this repo, that means I am adding value in that case. Thank you for appreciating me, man ................................. 

Here, I want to clarify something: Iâ€™ve been working on this project for almost 2 months now, and today is 21-04-25. I think I will need an additional 2-3 months to make it a fully-fledged project because this will be going to be a production-level, ready, huge web app with 100% security. I will apply all my knowledge and learn a lot in the process.

With that, I also know that this project can be used, but there may be bugs, which I am aware of and can easily be noticed. So, over time, I will add step by step, and I will continue working on it daily.

I know this may not be at a huge production level yet, but believe me, this will teach me a lot, and I will face many challenges along the way. So, if you're someone who is learning and interested in collaboration, feel free to connect with me:
